## About

I'm a final-year Mechanical Engineering student at Liverpool John Moores University with a knack for bridging the gap between physical engineering and software. Whether it's optimising a suspension upright through FEA or writing a Discord bot from scratch, I enjoy solving problems across disciplines.

This portfolio covers my work in:

- **Mechanical Engineering** — FEA, topology optimisation, CAD, suspension design
- **Software Development** — Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, MATLAB, Discord bots, web apps
- **Maker & Electronics** — 3D printing, Arduino, soldering, motor control, mechatronics
- **Simulation & Tools** — ANSYS, BeamNG, SolidWorks, data acquisition
